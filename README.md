# dim-nn
A super short neural network written in C++.

Q: Why is it dim?
A: Because it's not that bright.

Q: What is it good for?
A: Learning about neural networks and backpropagation.

Q: What is it not good for?
A: Anything else.

Q: Will it ever be good for anything else?
A: Probably not. If I ever learn enough about them I would like to implement a convolutional layer.
